## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`appsettings.json`)

The game's logic and outcomes are driven by the following configuration:

```json
"BetOptions": {
  "SmallestBet": 1.00,
  "BiggestBet": 10.00,
  "Loss": {
    "Chance": 0.5
  },
  "SmallWin": {
    "Chance": 0.4,
    "WinRatioStart": 1.01,
    "WinRatioEnd": 2.00
  },
  "BigWin": {
    "Chance": 0.1,
    "WinRatioStart": 2.01,
    "WinRatioEnd": 10.00
  }
}

## üìù Notes:

* The sum of Loss.Chance, SmallWin.Chance, and BigWin.Chance should equal 1.0.
* WinRatioStart and WinRatioEnd determine the multiplier for winnings.
